                    Thursday April 02 2020 by .<br>
                    <br>
                    As we all spend more time at home, and inevitably, online and on social media, during the
                    coronavirus pandemic,
                    it’s just as important as ever to be on the lookout for scams and fraudulent behavior.<br>
                    <br>
                    While it’s our hope that most people are acting toward the greater good, there are always a few
                    people who look
                    to take advantage of others during a crisis.<br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-5">
                <img src="/Images/News Content/covid.pjp">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            There’s no reason to panic, but we do ask you to be
            alert for any emails, websites or apps that seem suspicious.<br>
            <br>
            You may notice a number of emails and websites promising vital information about keeping people safe from
            the
            coronavirus; unfortunately, many of these are scams that are pushing malware, ransomware and misinformation.
            They may also be attempting to steal passwords and personal information.<br>
            <br>
            One of the most recent coronavirus hoaxes is an Android App called COVID19 Tracker App. This app claims it
            can
            provide access to a map that shows real-time virus-tracking as well as important information such as
            statistics
            and heat maps, when in reality, the app is infected with ransomware.<br>
            <br>
            We also encourage you to be on the lookout for new phishing scams. An example of this is an email that went
            out
            to college students posing as official communication from their university, offering bogus updates about
            closures and other coronavirus-related news. Another variation of this type of email scam will appear to
            come
            from employers and target employees who are working from home, providing fake links to vendor login screens
            that
            will capture user’s credentials.<br>
            <br>
            Coupon scams are also rampant during times of crisis. For example, a recent offer promising a $100 gift card
            toward Starbucks turned out to be fraudulent. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.<br>
            <br>
            Most importantly, please be careful of any website or individuals advertising sales of medical supplies, as
            they
            are most likely online shopping scams. Once your banking information is entered, the products you ordered
            would
            not only not arrive, but your account information would be compromised.<br>
            <br>
            Snopes.com recently reported a scam in which fraudsters impersonated Red Cross volunteers in an attempt to
            victimize worried individuals. These individuals claimed that they were working for Red Cross and were
            offering
            COVID-19 home tests door-to-door. They were then able to charge their victims for a service that they never
            administered.<br>
            <br>
            Beyond this, hundreds of website domains have recently popped up promising home testing for the coronavirus.
            As
            of now, there are no official home tests for the virus.<br>
            <br>
            To keep yourself and your information safe, always be skeptical of emails and websites that purport to
            provide
            information or goods related to the ongoing pandemic. If you are working remotely, always connect to a
            secured
            wireless network, and ensure that your home network passwords are long and cannot be easily guessed.<br>
            <br>
            Good luck, and stay safe!<br>
